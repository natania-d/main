== Overview

PrioriTask is a desktop task manager application written in Java (10~20kLOC).
It helps users manage their tasks and priorities through automatic priority updating and sorting.
The application also features a calendar which provides users with a chronological overview of upcoming deadlines.
The user interacts with PrioriTask by using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to recur tasks weekly*
** What it does: allows the user to recur tasks weekly. The tasks that are recurred have deadlines that are on the same day of the week as the original task.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can add tasks that need to be done weekly much more quickly, as compared to with just the feature to add tasks one by one.
** Highlights: This feature was difficult to implement because there are many ways a user may want to recur a task. Finding a way to recur tasks that can fit most users' needs was a challenge.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a remove tag command that allows the user to remove a specified tag from all entries in PrioriTask.
