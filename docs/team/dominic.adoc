== PROJECT: PrioriTask

---

== Overview

PrioriTask is a desktop task manager application written in Java (10~20kLOC).
It helps users manage their tasks and priorities through automatic priority updating and sorting.
The application also features a calendar which provides users with a chronological overview of upcoming deadlines.
The user interacts with PrioriTask by using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

[NOTE]
PrioriTask used https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level 4] as a base for development.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *login system*
** What it does: allows the multiple users to use the application on the same machine. Supports account creation, login, logout, password retrieval, and most importantly private task management.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user now has an additional layer of security for the privacy of their own tasks.
** Highlights: This enhancement affected all four components : `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `UI`. Due to the the reliance of this feature on data structures and logic, changes were mainly made to `Logic`, `Model`, and `Storage`. Code was also ammended in `UI` as the login system presents a stricter restriction on what is displayed on the GUI. Due to the already existing data structure of *https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level 4]*, numerous challenges were faced as the initial design was not optimized for a login system. The current implementation, although not optimally designed due to the amount of time required to rework the data structure and tests, currently works as intended.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a *Priority* parameter, and its corresponding *auto-updating and autosorting feature* (Refer to https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#task-s-priority-auto-updating-and-auto-sorting-feature[PrioriTask - Developer Guide : 4.2. Taskâ€™s Priority Auto-updating and Auto-sorting feature] to find our more).
** What it does: Automatically updates `Priority` levels of tasks upon application launch and sorts then in descending order.
** Justification: This feature helps automate task management for the user, which is a key distinction that seperates PrioriTask from other applications.
** Highlights: This enhancement mainly dealt with `UniqueTaskList` in `Model`. The formula and algorithm for appropriate priority updating faced many challenges due to its dependence on the current date, resulting in the need for in-depth testing to constantly refine it.
