== PROJECT: PrioriTask

PrioriTask is a desktop task management application. It is a combination of the to-do list, and calendar features, with an added bonus of automatic updating and sorting of the tasks based on priority levels.

The user interacts with PrioriTask by using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

This application is based on the https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4 (AB4)] project created by _https://github.com/se-edu/[SE-EDU] initiative_. It is written in Java, and has about 10 ~ 20 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *a calendar*
** What it does: Allows users to have a have a chronological overview of the deadlines of all their tasks, and to switch between different months.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users  would want at-a-glance views of upcoming tasks by month so that they can effectively keep track of their tasks. The GUI was created with JavaFX, and interacts with the `Model` and `Logic` components for users to execute the respective CLI commands. This enhancement  required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing GUI, and no third-party calendar library was used to draw the calendar.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
