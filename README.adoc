PrioriTask is a desktop task management application. It is not just any task management application, but a combination of the to-do list, calendar and reminder features, with an added bonus of automatic updating and sorting of your tasks based on priority levels.

PrioriTask's main aim is to help busy university students keep track of their many tasks and priorities. This application is most suitable for students who:

* have an endless number of tasks to keep track of
* require help to monitor their tasks and their levels of importance
* would like assistance in task planning
* prefer a digital organizer over a physical organizer
* prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Do you have any of the characteristics listed above? If so, then PrioriTask is the application for you!
